    keys that were created with ssh-keygen.
  - When a session contained output and was scrolled back half way, if
    ALT+<left click> was used to do a column select, the selection
    would not scroll beyond the visible terminal area even though there
    was output below.
  - Windows: If a session had the global option "Show connection closed
    dialog" set and the "Close on disconnect" session option was set,
    typing "exit" in the session caused SecureCRT to crash.

No changes.


Changes in SecureCRT 8.3 (Beta 4) -- November 2, 2017
-----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash if a script was attempting to connect to a
    Serial session in one window while another window was attempting
    to connect to a Serial session and both were using the same serial
    port.
  - If a button in the Button bar was mapped to run a script or launch
    an application that was not located in the SecureCRT install folder,
    after SecureCRT closed and restarted, the script or application
    field was blank.
  - Forward slashes specified in the Arguments field in a Button bar
    button that launched an application were converted to backslashes.
  - When Find was used to search for text in a session and the Find
    dialog was left open, if the screen and scrollback were cleared,
    attempting to find text using the Find dialog did not work.
  - When options that should take effect immediately were changed in the
    Default session and applied to all sessions, the changes were not
    honored until a reconnect occurred.
  - The script method Config.Save() could not be used to overwrite
    existing sessions.
  - When SecureCRT and SecureFX were integrated and the "Cache session
    password" option was on, if quick connect was used to connect to an
    SSH2 host that used password authentication and then SecureFX was
    launched, automatically connecting to the same SSH2 host, the
    password had to be re-entered.
  - Windows: SecureCRT could crash when the computer woke from Sleep or
    Hibernate mode.
  - Mac: SecureCRT crashed if the Find dialog was open and the session
    tab that was active when it was opened went away while the Close

    still went into full-screen mode when COMMAND+ENTER was pressed.
  - Mac: Switching between tabs could be slow when there was no default
    printer.
  - Mac: Specifying a Korean log file name by selecting "Log Session"
    from the file name resulted in a corrupted log file name.
  - Mac: If SHIFT+ENTER was pressed in the Session Manager, pressing
    ENTER to connect a session no longer worked until SecureCRT was
    restarted.
  - Mac: After connecting and disconnecting a session, if a session was

Changes in SecureCRT 8.3 (Beta 1) -- September 21, 2017
-------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added several new built-in color schemes, including the Solarized
    color schemes.  There is a variety of light and dark color

    and ANSI color combinations.
  - Multiple global ANSI color palettes can be defined and a specific
    color palette can be specified for a color scheme.
  - Added autocomplete to the Connect bar in the toolbar, which makes
    finding and connecting to saved sessions easier.
  - When the SecureCRT window is resized, the text in the terminal
    area is rewrapped if the "On resize" option is set to "Synchronize
    view to size".
  - A paste confirmation dialog option allows you to preview the
    contents of the paste buffer before pasting multiple lines of text
    into a session. 
  - Multiple sessions can be dragged and dropped or copied and pasted in
    the Session Manager and Connect dialog.
  - SSH2: Added support for the ChaCha20/Poly1305 cipher.
  - SSH2: Added support for the AES-GCM cipher.
  - SSH2: Added support for the UMAC-128 MAC algorithm.
  - SSH2: Added the ability to use OpenSSH certificates for
    authenticating SSH2 sessions.
  - SSH2: If a session cannot be cloned or connected using SFTP on the
    existing SSH connection, SecureCRT will create a new connection.
  - Added a tab context menu item that closes all sessions in the
    current tab group.
  - Added the ability to script session locking from the Session
    object.
  - Added a substitution parameter %F that can be used to specify the
    session's subfolder in a log filename.
  - Added a command-line option /FORWARDX11PACKETS to enable X11
    forwarding.
  - Platform-specific configuration settings such as font and window
    position are now stored separately for each platform which is
    helpful if settings are saved on a network drive and used on
    different platforms.
  - Windows: Added an Administrative Policy option to disconnect
    sessions authenticated using CAPI/PKCS#11 when the corresponding
    smart card is removed.
  - Windows: Added the ability to hide the title bar for the Command
    window.

    SecureCRT is available and if there is, clicking a button downloads
    and installs it.
  - Mac: Arguments can now be passed to a local application that is
    launched when a tunnel is established.

Changes:

  - Up to 16 sessions can be included on the recent session list.
  - Middle clicking on the title bar of a tiled session closes the
    session.
  - Added a global INI-file-only option to specify the script path.
  - The session level ANSI colors were removed since multiple global
    ANSI color palettes can be created.
  - SSH2: Modified the default authentication order to be PublicKey,
    Keyboard Interactive, Password, and GSSAPI.  This only affects
    new installations.
  - The session option "Minimize drawing (faster)" is now on by
    default.  This change only affects new installations.
  - The default session filter delay has been changed from 500
    milliseconds to 250 milliseconds.  This only affects new
    installations.
  - For SSH1 and SSH2 sessions, if the session option "Backspace sends
    Delete" is set, the opcode for Erase is set to ^? (delete), which
    results in stty -a reporting erase = ^? and tells the terminal that
    the erase character is Delete. 
  - The keyboard accelerators ALT+1 through ALT+0 only operate on the
    current tab group.
  - Added support for the %P logging substitution for Serial sessions.
  - If the global option "Show Session Manager or Connect dialog on
    startup" is set, the Session Manager is displayed when SecureCRT
    starts.  Previously, only the Connect dialog honored this option.
  - If SecureCRT is launched using the -F command-line parameter or
    is on a USB drive, the actual configuration path being used is
    shown in the Global Options dialog. 
  - When saving a recorded script, if the file extension is blank, the
    appropriate .vbs or .py extension is used.
  - SSH2: If a session is using public-key authentication and the key
    file has not been specified, the user is no longer prompted to
    specify the file.
  - SSH2: When importing an SSH2 host key, if it's possible to extract
    the hostname, IP address, and port from the filename, those values
    will be used as the default values.  Otherwise, the default
    value for port will be set to 22 and the other values will be
    left blank.
  - SSH2: When being prompted to accept an SSH2 host key, the
    fingerprints are now shown in a separate dialog.
  - SSH2: Pressing the SHIFT key in the New Host Key dialog allows a
    host key to be saved once.
  - In the View Host Key dialog, all the fingerprints can be
    selected at once.
  - In the View Host Key dialog, SHA-2 fingerprints are displayed
    in base64 in addition to hexadecimal.
  - SSH2: In the dialogs that prompt to accept the host key, the
    SHA-2 fingerprint is also displayed in base64.
  - SSH2: The trace output shows the SHA-2 host key fingerprint as
    base64 in addition to hexadecimal. 
  - The username used for authentication is now logged in the trace
    output.
  - Trace output now includes printer initialization information.
  - The Send String field in the Map Button and Map Selected Key
    dialogs was made larger vertically and horizontally.
  - The X11 forwarding display option can now be configured in the
    Session Options dialog.
  - Mac: For new installations, the global option "Use keychain" is
    off by default.
  - Mac/Linux: A custom baud rate for Serial sessions can be entered
    by typing into the Baud rate field in the Session Options dialog.

    manually by typing into the Port field.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when the system time went to midnight if the
    logging option "Start new log at midnight" was set and the log
    file name contained the substitution parameter %D.
  - Windows: SecureCRT crashed if a session was being configured
    and the protocol was changed while a TAPI system prompt was
    displayed.
  - A session could become slow or non-responsive if another session
    was receiving and logging a lot of output.
  - Filtered searches in the Session Manager and Connect dialog could be
    very slow when the session database contained thousands of sessions.
  - Using Quick Connect to connect to a Serial session did not work.
  - TFTP transfers failed when an IPv6 address was used for the remote
    system (macOS Sierra uses IPv6 addresses by default.)
  - When an illegal character, such as a colon, was used in a log file
    name, logging failed silently.  Illegal characters can no longer be
    used in a log file name.
  - In the New Session wizard and the Quick Connect dialog, once a
    session was selected as the Firewall, "Select Session..." was no
    longer in the Firewall dropdown list.
  - If a session was configured to start logging upon connect and
    "Log Session" or "Raw Log Session" was selected from the File menu
    before connecting to that session, logging was turned off.
  - If a button bar name was empty or contained a quote character ("),
    the button bar was not available after SecureCRT restarted.  Button
    bar names can no longer be empty or contain quote characters.
  - Long button bar names were not completely visible in the button bar
    dropdown list.
  - If a value larger than 32,000 was entered as the maximum number
    of columns in the Global Options dialog, no error was reported and
    a smaller value was used.
  - Attempting to modify protocol-specific options after changing the
    protocol for a SessionConfig object in a script did not work.
  - If the protocol options /SSH2, /SSH1, or /TELNET were specified on
    the command line or in the Connect bar without specifying a host, an
    error was reported.
  - Windows: If a session tab had focus or the mouse hovered over a
    session tab, pressing ALT+<spacebar> did not bring up the Windows
    system menu.
  - Windows: If the Connect bar was showing a dropdown list,
    pressing ALT+Q displayed the Quick Connect dialog, but did not
    put focus there.
  - Windows: Some printer setting changes made from the Print Setup
    dialog were not saved.
  - Windows: On high-DPI monitors, the EULA dialog in the installer did
    not display correctly.
  - Linux: In Ubuntu 16, toolbar icons and dialog fonts were not
    displayed properly with high-DPI settings.
